   <p>LANGLEY VA&ndash;&ndash; A report release Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.</p>
   <p>According to the report, sections of the documents&ndash;&ndash;"almost invariably the most crucial passages"&ndash;&ndash; are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947</p>
   <p>CIA Director <b>Porter Goss</b> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>the Cold War</li>
    <li>the civil-rights movement</li>
    <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
   </ul>
