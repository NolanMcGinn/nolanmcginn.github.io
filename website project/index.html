    <p>Are you tired of your neighbors always letting their animals on your property and not cleaning up after them? Well then you can to the right place here at moat builders we make sure that your neighbors or their animals will never be able to come onto your property without asking you to come in. Now I know what your thinking, "Couldn't they just put wood over and walk over onto my yard still?" but let me tell you we thought of that for you. No need to worry about people trying to build over onto your land as we will also add tiger sharks in the moat as well to make sure no one every lays foot on your property without your permission</p>
