<div class="para-1">
    <p>
       Here at Polar Bear Rescuers we are striving to make the world a better place for the polar bears to live! We don't believe that polar bears should be kept in cages at zoos and they should be in their habitat in the wild. We think think that even if they are needing to be rehabilitated that we should be doing it in their habitat so they will be able to go back into the wild and continue to keep populating.

    <h2>Our Plan</h2>
</div>

<div class="para-2">
    <p>
       We are striving to make more small hospitable ares that humans are able to live at for short periods or times while not being a pollutant to the environment. We want to be able to observer the animals while we help them in the rehabilitation process. We don't want to disturb these animals while they are in the wild(ie. We wont get involved in the cycle of life for the adult polar bears) we only want to help the baby's incase they wont make it so we can keep theses animals from going extinct.
    </p>

    <h2>How You Can Help</h2>
</div>

<div class="para-3">
    <p>
        Right now we are only asking for donations from people that would like to help out in our mission. We are also making a job-listing where once we are up and running you will be able to go to these animals and help us observe and treat the baby's if anything is to happen. You will learn how to help without disruption the ecosystem and help the polar bears migrate back into normal life where they will have to hunt and fend for themselves.
