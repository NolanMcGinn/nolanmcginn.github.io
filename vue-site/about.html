      <p>We are a small local company that started in the 70s. Our parents started this store with the little money that they had at the time and left it for us when they passed. We have continued to go how they wanted us to by followiung their motto for the store "No mater what they need we will get it for them cheap" We can get you anything and everything that is legal for purchase and sale. We hope you enjoy the service you get and are happy with what we provide you.</p>
