          <h2>About The Site</h2>
          <p>
            We made this site to showcase dog we found that we found were either
            very cute or doing something super cool. We found it very a nice way
            to relax after a stressful day unwind and see some cute or funny
            dogs. We hope that you find as much enjoyment out of this site as we
            do and will snd in you pictures of dogs for us to use.
          </p>

            We are always more than thirlled to show other pictures of dogs that poeple have gotten. We will put your name and the name of the pup (if you know the name) next to the picture so everyone know who he is.
