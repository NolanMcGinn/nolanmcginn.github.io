     <h5>What Made Us Want To Do This</h5>
     <p>We decided to do this after years of not being able to get our hands on new trendy products and got fed up with it.
        We feel that items should be kept hidden when they can be very useful or even just something fun to have. We always would see people posting wiht their new products and tlaking about
        how nice it was to have it. It really sucked seeing it all the time esspecially when it was being made by a small company and they had a long wait time to get the items in your own hands.
        After a lot of thought we figured out we could find these companys and be ahead of the curve and be ready for they day they are dropping these items. We thought why should we hid this from everyone when 
        others can be in our same position and we decided to make a website for all of these products so poeple can know what to expect in the comming months or even years!
