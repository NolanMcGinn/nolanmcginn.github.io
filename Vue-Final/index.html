        <h5>Here at Trendy New stuff we are hoping to show you all the new and trendy things comming to you soon.</h5>
        <p>We will showcase these products as well as a description for them so you can see if it will be something worth buying for your family or even yourself. 
            We find it important to be able to see these things before they come onto the market because once they do they will typically be sold out instantly and you wont
            get the chance to get it before you start seeing videos of them everywhere. We want to get people all these items so they are able to enjoy them without them getting
            spoiled by the internet.
        </p>
        <p>Right now we are just a small company run by 2 people so we will be trying to get every product up that we can in hopes to stay ahead of the trends. We will also be showing products that
            we feel will become very trendy in the future.
        </p>
