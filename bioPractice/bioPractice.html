    <h1>About Nolan McGinn</h1>

    <p class="intro">Over the past decade of my life, I have found myself working and studying a variety of subjects. Throughout this journey, however, I have always reserved for myself a profound and present interest in computer technology and software development. I would find myself as a teenager scouring the internet for how-too and guides to learn Python. I was fascinated with the multitude of options I saw before me to unleash my creativity.</p>

    <h2>Work Experience</h2> 

    <p>While my interests in software remained in the background, I have accomplished many things in my professional career. I have worked in restaurants, and framed houses for construction firms. Most importantly, in December 2020, I passed the Real Estate Bar and became a professional <i>Realtor</i> in the State of Idaho. I worked as a full-time <i>Realtor</i> in Idaho for a couple years, until in 2022, I decided I wanted to pursue an <strong>Associate Degree in Software Development</strong> at the <i>College of Western Idaho</i>. I am thankful for my prior experience in construction and real estate, as it has given me many tools for success in pursuit of my degree.</p>
